# Welcome

This book exists because the main README was getting unwieldy, and nobody wants to scroll through a novel to find where they left off.

The whole point here is simple: learn AI without becoming dependent on AI to do the learning for you. The difference is that one day you'll be able to create something original, and the other day you'll starve when the delivery apps go down.

## What You'll Find Here

The wiki is organized into learning modules that build upon each other, because that's how knowledge works, despite what the internet may lead you to believe. Each section includes the theory you need to understand, the math you can't skip, and projects that will make you question your life choices before making you slightly more competent.

There are study notes from me, wisdom borrowed from anonymous Reddit philosophers who've graciously shared their hard-won insights (most hide behind usernames like "DeepLearningDegenerate42," hoping their future employers never connect the dots), project documentation that chronicles every spectacular failure and face-palm moment, and resources. Books get dissected, YouTube videos face the guillotine of honest critique, and articles are put through the ringer of actual usefulness rather than just dumped into yet another "47 Essential AI Channels" listicle that reads like everyone copied-pasted from the same source.

The goal here isn't just technical competence, though that's important unless you enjoy being professionally irrelevant. This is about becoming a more complete human being who can navigate both code and conversations, debug algorithms and personal relationships, optimize neural networks and life decisions. Consider me your slightly unhinged life coach who happens to believe that learning to think clearly about artificial intelligence somehow makes you better at thinking clearly about everything else.
