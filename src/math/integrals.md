# Integrals

Integrals accumulate change over intervals. While less immediately critical than derivatives for basic ML, they're essential for probability theory, statistics, and advanced AI topics.

## The Core Idea

An integral finds the area under a curve. If derivatives ask "how fast is this changing?", integrals ask "how much total change happened?"

In probability, integrals let you work with continuous distributions. In machine learning, they show up in expectation calculations, normalization constants, and theoretical analysis.

## Basic Techniques

Fundamental theorem: integration and differentiation are inverse operations. If F'(x) = f(x), then âˆ«f(x)dx = F(x) + C.

## AI Applications

Probability density functions integrate to 1. Expected values are integrals of x times the probability density.

Gaussian integrals show up everywhere in statistics and Bayesian methods. Many loss functions involve integral formulations.

You don't need to be an integration wizard initially, understanding the concept and being able to handle basic integrals is crucial for the mathematical foundations of AI.
